WARNING: Running the client will completely and irrecoverably wipe _all_ devices attached to the client computer.

DO NOT RUN WITH A PHONE ATTACHED WHICH CONTAINS DATA YOU WANT TO KEEP!

Launching the client

Run ./bootstrap in the client directory. This will enumerate all devices attached and launch a separate worker for each one.

Requirements

Bootstrapping a device requires some parts of the Ubuntu SDK on the client. Obtain them thus:-

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb ubuntu-device-flash click-reviewers-tools phablet-tools exiftool jq zip

Limitations

* Devices will have no nework access - this may be added later, but will be limited
* Cannot control what screenshots are taken. Currently 4 are taken:-
  - Pre-launch - so developer can see the icon and description in the app scope
  - Immediately after launch - so developer can see the splash screen
  - 5 seconds after launch and 10 seconds after launch
* Cannot yet control touch or other gestures
